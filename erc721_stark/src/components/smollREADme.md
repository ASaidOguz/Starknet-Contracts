## Components
Components are like modular addons that can be snapped into contracts to add reusable logic, storage, and events. They are used to separate the core logic from common functionalities, simplifying the contractâ€™s code and making it easier to read and maintain. It also reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities by using well-tested components.

- Modularity: easly pluggable into multiple contracts.
- Reusable logics :Encapsulates specific functionalities.
- No standalone.Cannot be declared or deployed independently
